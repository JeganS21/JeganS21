Hi, I’m [Jegan S](https://github.com/JeganS21/) 👋🏻. I'm Part time UI & UX Designer ( [@Adobe XD]() ).  

Unfortunately I'm a Student [@Kongunadu College Of Engineering and Technology](http://www.kongunadu.ac.in/).  
I've Previously interned [@YalinTech](https://www.yalin.tech/).
Obviously I’m interested to learn the functionality of a code.  
I’m currently learning [#Web Development]().  
Right Now, I’m looking to collaborate on an intern which offers me a better training.
